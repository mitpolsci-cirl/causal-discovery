Literature about causal discovery


## analogy of SuppChain to Causal Relations
- Input A -> Output B interpreted as Causal Relation.
   - Any loophole in this relationship?

- (Emprical) How's the output result causal graph discovered by current literature over SuppChian 
   - Does it reflect the Ground Truth well?   
   - (Corr vs Casuation) Soybean -> fed to -> Pig (and) Pig -> proceessed into -> Lad, Soybean will have correlation with Lad, however, that's not interpreted as direct neighbor in terms of SupplyChain
